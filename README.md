# Volunteers Welcome!
[EnCiv](http://enciv.org) Is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to making democracy work better online. There are several reasons to volunteer here, perhaps it's to further the mission, or perhaps it's to get real-world experience, or learn a new talent, or perhaps you have lots of experience and want to give back.

If you would like to get involved, join the [slack](https://enciv.slack.com) workspace.  We have regular meetings online on Wedensdays at 6:30pm Pacific Time.  See the Slack channel for announcments and links.

Here are some of the things we are looking for, technical and non-technical.

## Marketing Director
We're building it, but that dosen't mean the people will come.  How do we bring them here?  And, after people come, how do we quickly excite them with the value of what this will do and get them to sign up and get started? We're looking for someone who can take charge and help with this. What should the new enciv.org website look like? What should the tag line be? How should we engage with social media and what channels? These are just some of the areas where we need someone with marketing instincts to take the lead. 

## React and Javascript Front End
The unpoll and undebate projects are built with React and the pages are animated, and undebates uses video. This means it's more than just layout, there are some advanced javascript things to do.  If you know how, or if you are interested in working animation or video, here is a great opportunity.

## Explainer Video Creator 
Explainer Videos make a big difference in getting people's attention.  We need help with developing the scripts, and doing the animation.  This is the explainer video for candidates, about Candidate Conversations - (undebates). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlhrzVUAIpo

## Node User Account Development
Our platform is built on Node, and we are creating a server 'component' that projects can use and extend, in order to get user account management.  We are looking for help doing things like forgot-password, and two factor authentication, and more.  And we are interestsed in using [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/)
